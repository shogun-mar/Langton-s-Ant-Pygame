# Langton's Ant Simulation in Pygame

This project is a simulation of the cellular automata named Langton's Ant made with Pygame.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

Paiting like image:
```sh
python painting_like_image.py
```
Colony like simulation:
```sh
python colony.py
```
Small simulation with the possiblity of changing the color of the ants and live counters to visually keep track of the status of the simulation:
```sh
python gui.py
```
Flies like behaviour:
```sh
python flies.py
```

Many other interesting patterns and behaviour can be found by tweaking the settings of each simulation.
